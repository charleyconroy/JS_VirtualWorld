This project is following the Build a Virtual World Filled with Self-Driving Cars series from freecodecamp.org
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-virtual-world-with-javascript/

As of the latest push, I have completed the third segment of the series. I have implemented a point and click interface
and a graph to set up what will eventually become roads in this mini world that is being set up. Additionally I have
implemented basic save and load functionality in local storage, along with zoom, map dragging, and clearing the screen
functionality.
